# Knowledge: Information Based Decisions


The course focuses on the application of predictive and causal statistical inference for decision making across a wide range of scenarios and contexts. The first part of the course focuses on parametric and non-parametric predictive modeling (regression, cross-validation, bootstrapping, random forests, etc.). The second part of the course focuses on causal inference in randomized control trials and observational studies (statistical matching, synthetic control methods, encouragement design/instrument variables, regression discontinuity design, etc.). Technical aspects of the course focus on computational approaches and real-world challenges, drawing cases from the life sciences, public policy and political science, education, and business. This course also emphasizes the importance of being able to articulate oneâ€™s findings effectively and tailor methodology and policy/decision-relevant recommendations for different audiences.
